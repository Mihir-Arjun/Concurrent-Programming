# Concurrent-Programming
Computer science courses mostly deal with sequential programs. This repository looks at the fundamentals of concurrency; what it means, how it can be exploited, and what facilities are available to determine program correctness. Concurrent systems are designed, analysed and implemented.

In terms of the different concepts implemented the following can be found in the different practicals above:
- Peterson Lock
- Filter Lock
- Bakery Lock
- Atomic MRMW, MRSW and SRSW Registers
- MCS Queues
- Fine Grain Optimization
- Optimistic Lists
- Lazy Lists
- Non-Blocking Lists
- Lock Free Queues
- Lock Free Stacks
